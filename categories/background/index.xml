If you are reading this, I&#39;d bet dollars to donuts you already take notes frequently.  But, if this is not the case, I
am sorry.  Not just because you are missing a great opportunity to maximize the production of your brain, but rather
because of what you have missed so far.  But, don&#39;t worry.  It ain&#39;t late to join the club.  The sooner, the better.</p>
<p>
I must also acknowledge that this is not a comprehensive guide on note taking, but rather a series of tips that I
consider useful.  Although, I will not chicken out on sharing my reasons for taking notes, the focus will be on
describing how to get the most out of them.  I am sharing my experience here and would love to hear about yours.  Feel
free to ping me in any of the social media platforms, using the links on the home page, if you need, and let me know
other tips that have been useful to you.  I am looking forward to learning more on the topic!</p>]]></description>
