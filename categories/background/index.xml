This is the last article of a series on taking notes.  In the previous ones, I shared the reasons why I think taking
notes is useful as well as some of the things that I do when I take my notes.  This article contains ways of making use
of the effort that we have put into writing those notes.  Some of them are specifically geared toward digital notes and
won&#39;t be very useful for handwritten notes, but there is one which applies only to notes on paper. ðŸ˜‰</p>]]></description>

This is the second article of a series on taking notes.  In the previous one, I listed my reasons for taking notes as
well as a few rules of thumb for deciding when it is worth to take a note about a topic.  In this article, I will focus
on the most practical aspects of note taking and I will share how I do it.  It shouldn&#39;t come as a shock that these
aren&#39;t the Note Commandments, but my experience and way of doing things.  I am quite happy with most of them, but there
is always room for improvement and I will be glad to hear from you and how you tackle the scenarios that I have
described here or any others that might be relevant.</p>]]></description>

If you are reading this, I&#39;d bet dollars to donuts you already take notes frequently.  But, if this is not the case, I
am sorry.  Not just because you are missing a great opportunity to maximize the production of your brain, but rather
because of what you have missed so far.  But, don&#39;t worry.  It ain&#39;t late to join the club.  The sooner, the better.</p>
<p>
I must also acknowledge that this is not a comprehensive guide on note taking, but rather a series of tips that I
consider useful.  Although, I will not chicken out on sharing my reasons for taking notes, the focus will be on
describing how to get the most out of them.  I am sharing my experience here and would love to hear about yours.  Feel
free to ping me in any of the social media platforms, using the links on the home page, if you need, and let me know
other tips that have been useful to you.  I am looking forward to learning more on the topic!</p>]]></description>
