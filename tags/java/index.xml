I must confess.  For many years, I have tried to avoid front-end web development by all means.  I didn&#39;t want to touch
it with a ten foot pole.  And the main reason was because I have never felt comfortable with having to combine HTML, CSS
and JavaScript with the nuances of each of the browsers to get the UI I wanted to produce.</p>
<p>
When it came to develop user interfaces for my applications, I have preferred to use well established APIs.  I started,
looong ago, writing some small Windows applications, moved to X Window first and then to GTK, and after a while focused
on mobile development.  Even at that stage, I jumped from PalmOS to Android and iOS, almost skipping webOS<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> because
of it being based on web development.</p>]]></description>
