In the article introducing this series, I shared that I wanted to explore full-stack app development.  In particular, I
wanted to develop a full-stack application that helps people manage their checklists.  Users will use a browser to
connect to the front-end server, which, in turn, will use the API provided by the back-end server to access and modify
the checklists.</p>
<p>
This article is the first one describing what I am doing in Go.  I will cover project creation and structure, and build
automation.  We won&#39;t have much of the application implemented by the end of this article, but it should be a good and
helpful start. So buckle up and let&#39;s get cracking!</p>]]></description>

This article is the first one describing what I am doing in Java + Spring.  I will cover project creation and structure,
and build automation.  We won&#39;t have much of the application implemented by the end of this article, but it should be a
