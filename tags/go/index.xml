In the article introducing this series, I shared that I wanted to explore full-stack app development.  In particular, I
wanted to develop a full-stack application that helps people manage their checklists.  Users will use a browser to
connect to the front-end server, which, in turn, will use the API provided by the back-end server to access and modify
the checklists.</p>
<p>
This article is the first one describing what I am doing in Go.  I will cover project creation and structure, and build
automation.  We won&#39;t have much of the application implemented by the end of this article, but it should be a good and
helpful start. So buckle up and let&#39;s get cracking!</p>]]></description>

I must confess.  For many years, I have tried to avoid front-end web development by all means.  I didn&#39;t want to touch
it with a ten foot pole.  And the main reason was because I have never felt comfortable with having to combine HTML, CSS
and JavaScript with the nuances of each of the browsers to get the UI I wanted to produce.</p>
<p>
When it came to develop user interfaces for my applications, I have preferred to use well established APIs.  I started,
looong ago, writing some small Windows applications, moved to X Window first and then to GTK, and after a while focused
on mobile development.  Even at that stage, I jumped from PalmOS to Android and iOS, almost skipping webOS<sup class="footnote-reference"><a id="footnote-reference-1" href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup> because
of it being based on web development.</p>]]></description>
