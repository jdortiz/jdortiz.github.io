Over the years, we have witnessed computer programs become more ambitious in their use of data, making it more useful to
us.  Thus, the programs of the 1950s to the 1980s were mostly focused on computing, on solving mathematical or
algorithmic problems that were hard to solve manually due to the complexity of the calculations.  Then, from the 80s to
the 2000s, with database software that could pull its weight, the focus shifted to storing, managing, and exploiting
data through analytical queries.  Dealing with customers, orders, products, invoices, and any other type of structured
data became accessible to any application.  The data could be handled reliably, ensuring integrity, consistency,
security, and availability. And performant when used properly, without worrying about low-level details.</p>]]></description>
